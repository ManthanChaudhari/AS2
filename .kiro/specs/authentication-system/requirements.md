# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing authentication system to provide a complete, robust authentication solution for the AS2 Pharmacovigilance Portal. The system will integrate with the existing OpenAPI specification endpoints, improve the current API service layer, and provide comprehensive authentication state management with automatic token refresh capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the API service endpoints to match the OpenAPI specification, so that the frontend can reliably communicate with the backend authentication services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the ApiServiceEndpoint file is updated THEN it SHALL include all authentication endpoints from openapi.json
2. WHEN an endpoint is defined THEN it SHALL use consistent naming conventions (LOGIN, REGISTER, REFRESH_TOKEN, USER_ME, LOGOUT)
3. WHEN endpoints are structured THEN they SHALL match the exact paths defined in the OpenAPI specification (/api/auth/login, /api/auth/register, etc.)
4. WHEN the openapi.json file is referenced THEN it SHALL remain as the single source of truth for API endpoint definitions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want enhanced API service functions for authentication, so that I can perform login, logout, register, and user management operations with consistent error handling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a login function is called THEN it SHALL send credentials to the correct endpoint and return a standardized response object
2. WHEN a logout function is called THEN it SHALL call the logout endpoint and clear local authentication state
3. WHEN a register function is called THEN it SHALL send registration data and handle the response appropriately
4. WHEN getCurrentUser function is called THEN it SHALL retrieve current user information from the /api/auth/me endpoint
5. WHEN refreshToken function is called THEN it SHALL use the refresh token to obtain new access tokens
6. WHEN any authentication API call fails THEN it SHALL return a consistent error response format with { data, error } structure
7. WHEN any authentication API call succeeds THEN it SHALL return a consistent success response format with { data, error } structure

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a comprehensive useAuth hook, so that I can manage authentication state and operations throughout the React application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the useAuth hook is used THEN it SHALL provide access to login, logout, register, getCurrentUser, and refreshToken methods
2. WHEN tokens are received THEN they SHALL be stored securely in localStorage
3. WHEN the application loads THEN it SHALL restore authentication state from stored tokens if they exist
4. WHEN a user state is maintained THEN it SHALL hold current user information accessible throughout the app
5. WHEN automatic token refresh is enabled THEN it SHALL call the refresh token API every 10-15 minutes using setInterval
6. WHEN tokens expire or refresh fails THEN it SHALL automatically log out the user and clear stored data
7. WHEN logout is called THEN it SHALL clear all stored tokens and user data from localStorage

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want an AuthProvider context wrapper, so that authentication state and methods are globally accessible throughout the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AuthProvider wraps the application THEN it SHALL provide global access to authentication state via React context
2. WHEN a component uses useContext(AuthContext) THEN it SHALL have access to user state and authentication methods
3. WHEN the application reloads THEN it SHALL persist the user session if valid tokens exist in storage
4. WHEN the AuthProvider initializes THEN it SHALL check for existing tokens and restore user session automatically
5. WHEN authentication state changes THEN it SHALL be immediately available to all consuming components

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want secure token management, so that user sessions are maintained securely and automatically refreshed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in successfully THEN both access and refresh tokens SHALL be stored securely
2. WHEN a user logs out THEN all stored tokens and user data SHALL be cleared immediately
3. WHEN tokens are refreshed THEN the new tokens SHALL replace the old ones in storage immediately
4. WHEN API requests are made THEN they SHALL automatically include the access token in Authorization headers
5. WHEN the access token is invalid or expired THEN the system SHALL attempt to refresh it automatically before retrying the request
6. WHEN both access and refresh tokens are invalid THEN the user SHALL be logged out automatically

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want my session to remain active without manual intervention, so that I can work continuously without frequent re-authentication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I am logged in THEN my session SHALL be automatically refreshed every 10-15 minutes
2. WHEN the automatic refresh succeeds THEN my session SHALL continue without interruption
3. WHEN the automatic refresh fails THEN I SHALL be logged out and redirected to the login page
4. WHEN I reload the page THEN my session SHALL be restored if valid tokens exist
5. WHEN my session expires THEN I SHALL receive appropriate feedback and be redirected to login

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent error handling across all authentication operations, so that users receive appropriate feedback and the application handles failures gracefully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authentication API call fails THEN it SHALL return a standardized error response
2. WHEN network errors occur THEN they SHALL be handled gracefully with appropriate user feedback
3. WHEN validation errors occur THEN they SHALL be displayed to the user in a clear format
4. WHEN authentication fails THEN the user SHALL receive specific feedback about the failure reason
5. WHEN token refresh fails THEN the user SHALL be automatically logged out and notified
